    For this page I am hoping to add multiple components for general tracking
    I will to see all games that are "In Progress"
    A component for games most recent changes to games
    A component for the X latest reviews (I would like this in a carousel I think)
    I want a component for the most recently added games
    A component for all active list. Should be in a carousel as well I think.
